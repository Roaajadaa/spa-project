            We are bombarded with information all day, every day on ways to look and feel better. You can look up recipes, workouts, and healthy tips from just about anywhere, but what do you do with all that information? As a wellness mentor, Centre Spa & Wellnessâ€™ Registered Dietician, Robin Neeb is here to help you sort through all the information and improve your quality of life by approaching your health from lifestyle changes.

Everyone wants a quick fix, but making lasting changes takes time. Often goals change and evolve throughout your journey and lead to much more than weight loss, including stress management, healthy sleep, and relationships. At your wellness consultation, we will discuss strengths, challenges, and personal goals and discover strategies to achieve goals. Follow-up sessions allow us to discuss actions taken toward goals and methods for successfully continuing them. Robin will help you take charge of your life, provide non-judgmental feedback, and offer encouragement and ideas that help you reach your own conclusions and solutions.

Contact the spa and schedule a Wellness Consultation with Robin Neeb, RD, your personal mentor, to guide you on your path to feeling great.</p>
